# YouTubeApp

> 🧱 **v1.5.0**: Just your normal YouTube… with adblock perfected! 🔥
> 🎭 **v2.0.0**: Same YouTube app — now with some animations no one asked for 😅 *(still in beta, no guarantee of future updates)*
> 📌 **Note**: I don’t follow semantic versioning. Versions are named progressively however I feel like. Simple as that.

A lightweight YouTube desktop client built with Electron, enhanced with powerful ad blocking and performance tweaks for a distraction-free viewing experience.

> ⚠️ **Disclaimer**: This is a personal project I built for use on my Ubuntu LTS system. It's essentially an Electron wrapper around YouTube with a custom toolbar and a few extra features like ad blocking. I do **not** plan to maintain this project regularly or ensure compatibility across all systems.
